## 2025-09-22: Design Thinking and Figma Wireframing ðŸŽ¨

This week, I delved into the **design thinking process**, focusing on its application in UI/UX. I practiced converting ideas into tangible visuals by sketching low-fidelity wireframes and creating a low-fi prototype.

### Key Learnings and Tools

* **Design Process:** Understood the fundamental steps of design thinking, from ideation to prototyping.
* **Digital Tools:** Explored and experimented with digital wireframing and prototyping applications, including **Figma** and **Wireframe.cc**.
* **Figma Deep Dive:** Initially found it challenging to grasp Figma's tools and workflow, but with guidance from my AI assistant (Gemini), I learned how to properly use it for my designs.

### Project & Accomplishment

* I successfully created my very first digital wireframe using Figma, using **Instagram** as my inspiration.This project helped me apply the core principles of layout and structure in a practical way.
* **Figma Project Link:** [Simple Instagram Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/kVdgNRIj6v9gupuMOpuliJ/App-practice?node-id=0-1&t=oDsJBH4XQFZnubLY-1)

### Challenge Overcome

* Successfully navigated the initial learning curve of Figma, and was able to use the platform to create my first wireframe thanks to tutorials and AI-powered guidance.

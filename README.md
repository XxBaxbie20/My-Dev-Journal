# ðŸ’» My Dev Journal â€“ ALX Frontend Learning

Welcome to my **Dev Journal**, where I document my ALX Frontend learning journey.  
This repository serves as both a personal work log and a portfolio of projects, exercises, and reflections.

## ðŸ“… Monthly Work Logs

Track my ALX Frontend learning progress month by month. Each log summarizes projects, exercises, and key learnings.

| Month | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| September 2025 | [September 2025 Work Log](./September_2025_Work_Log.md) |
| October 2025   | [October 2025 Work Log](./October_2025_Work_Log.md) |

> ðŸ”¹ **Tip:** Each monthly log contains all projects and accomplishments for that month.

## ðŸš€ How to Update

1. Create a new Markdown file for the new month, e.g., `November_2025_Work_Log.md`.  
2. Add it to the **Monthly Work Logs table** above.  
3. Stage, commit, and push changes to GitHub.

This keeps your Dev Journal **organized, easy to navigate, and scalable** for future months.
